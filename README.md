OAccounts
=========

OAccounts is an open standard for representing the financial data of an
organisation or company.

This repository is organised in two separate branches: The `master` branch,
which you are currently viewing, contains examples and code, while the
`gh-pages` branch contains the website and the specification text.

OAccounts is an initiative by [Martin Kleppmann](http://www.yes-no-cancel.co.uk).
