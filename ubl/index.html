<h1>Explore UBL</h1>

<p>The Universal Business Language (UBL) is a very comprehensive and complex standard. The documents provide
a great amount of flexibility and precision in the data they can represent, and the schemas are thus very
complicated.</p>

<p>These pages are intended as a resource for a newcomer to UBL; they should give you a quick and intuitive
overview of the structure of a typical UBL document, and allow you to explore the data model without having
to dig through the details of the schema.</p>

<p>Required elements are shown in deep colour, while optional elements are in a pale colour. Required attributes
are shown, while optional attributes are hidden (show them by clicking the three dots after the tag name).
Elements with complex content are collapsed, and you can expand them by clicking the tag name.</p>

<p>UBL documents illustrated here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Invoice.html">Invoice</a></li>
<!--
<li><a href="CreditNote.html">Credit note</a></li>
<li><a href="SelfBilledInvoice.html">Self-billed invoice</a></li>
<li><a href="SelfBilledCreditNote.html">Self-billed credit note</a></li>
<li><a href="Statement.html">Statement of account</a></li>
-->
</ul>

<p>This resource is work in progress. In particular, I hope to do the following before too long:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more types of document, in particular, CreditNote, SelfBilledInvoice, SelfBilledCreditNote and Statement</li>
<li>Pull human-readable documentation text out of the schemas and display it alongside the structure</li>
<li>Allow things which have been expanded to be collapsed again</li>
<li>Clarify the set of values to which certain attributes are restricted, e.g. code lists</li>
<li>Start defining a subset of UBL for small business use, and include an option in the UBL explorer to
    show only those elements/attributes which are part of the subset (to make it less overwhelming)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the documentation is currently extracted from the UBL XSD files via a Scala application.</p>
